              Our records show that you did not complete the RSVP form by the
              February 3rd deadline, which means we will not be expecting you at
              CxC 2025.

              in the future! Keep an eye on our upcoming events by following

              Unfortunately, weâ€™ve now reached full capacity for this yearâ€™s CxC
              data hackathon, and weâ€™re unable to offer you a spot at our
              hackathon. Every year, we receive an overwhelming number of strong
              applications, and this year was no exception. We truly appreciate
              your time and encourage you to apply again next year. Due to
              strict event capacity limits, we will not be accepting walk-in
              participants.
            </p>
            <br />
